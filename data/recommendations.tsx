        Bartek has <mark>made tremendous progress over time.</mark> I watched his beginnings, and
        accepting criticism wasn&apos;t easy for him. Gradually, Bartek realized the best way to
        grow as a developer is to learn from other people&apos;s experiences. Now he&apos;s
        successfully helping others in the community.

        I had a pleasure working together with Bartosz on a mobile application project. From very
        first day throughout our co-operation Bartosz showed{" "}
        <mark>big motivation and great technical skills.</mark>
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to very good programming skills he can also step out of his responsibilities and
        help push the work forward supporting other roles in the project and suggest improvements.
        Personally Bartosz is <mark>very easy and fun person to work with.</mark> I definitely
        recommend Bartosz for any future projects!
