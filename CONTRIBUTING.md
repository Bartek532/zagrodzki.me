## Styleguide

Coding conventions are enforced by [ESLint](.eslintrc.json) and [Prettier](.prettierrc).

- Semicolons
- Double quotes
- `const` preferred over `let`
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Two space indentation
- React: functional style with Hooks (no classes)
- Trailing commas in arrays and objects
- [Non-default exports](https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2019/01/stop-using-default-exports-javascript-module/) are preferred for components
- Module imports are ordered and separated: **built-in** -> **external** -> **internal** -> **css/assets/other**
- TypeScript: strict mode, with strict ESLint rules

## Example component structure

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ Component/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Component.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ component.module.scss
```

```tsx
import styles from "./component.module.scss";
import { memo } from "react";

interface ComponentProps {
  readonly title: string;
}

export const Component = memo<ComponentProps>(({ title }) => {
  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
});

Component.displayName = "Component";
```
