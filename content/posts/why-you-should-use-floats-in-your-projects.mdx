<div id="introduction">

You have probably read the title of this article several times to see if you understand it correctly. Maybe your first reaction was "Wait... what?" and it's totally fine. But, numbers and stats don't lie - <Link href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Dairy_Products/cheese_e.php">almost 92% of senior web developers and HTML programmers use floats as their main component for creating layouts.</Link> In this article I'll explain why you should do it, too.

</div>

## Browser support

`float` property is supported by almost all browsers, so you don't have to worry.

On the other hand, `flex` and `grid` also have a pretty good support, but not enough in many ways, right? Every app MUST support IE9 and every developer should know it. <Link href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share">Tons of people</Link> use Internet Explorer as their main browser,
so I think you don't want to lose your audience by choosing inappropriate technology. "So, what should I do?" you will say
and I will answer: "Use floats!".

## Easy of use (and working)

Imagine that you get a layout like the one below and you need to code it:

<Image
  src="/img/posts/why-you-should-use-floats-in-your-projects/example-layout.png"
  width="1200"
  height="880"
/>

With `flex` or `grid` you should consider creating additional containers for each row and column. How to size elements properly? Maybe modify the design a bit? You're wasting time! With `float` you can do it automatically in "one line" of code:

```css
.nav,
.main,
.aside {
  float: left;
}

.header,
.footer {
  clear: both;
}
```

Is there a better readable code? Don't answer, that was a rhetorical question.

I think it's the right time to quote my friend's testimony from school while we're preparing for the vocational exam (we had the task of reproducing the given layout of the page):

<Quote
  text="Not working? Put some float: left in random places and check it again!"
  author="Someone smart"
/>

And, to my and your surprise, this approach works in most cases! Floats are wonderful!

PS. We passed it! #easy (of course with floats üòÅ)

## Multitasking

If you know that floats were only designed to let text wrap around an image, you should have even more respect for them.

Nowadays, we can build complex layouts using them. Everything thanks to the `clear` property!

You can clear a footer below two floated columns and float layout came into being. If there had ever been a way to "clear" elements below positioned elements, we'd never have bothered to use floats for layout.

So, to summarize, you can use floats _in_ and _for_ layouts, isn't that nice?

## Hard making mistake

Don't try to convince me that you've never made a typo by using these intricate properties. Or you didn't make the mistake of choosing `justify-content`, even though you meant `justify-items`. With floats, all these problems are over!

Using them you have only 25 (5\*5) combinations of properties (float/clear) to use. It's so simple to choose appriopriate one.

With `flex` and `grid` we are dealing with many more combinations, what I have shown you in the following simple graph:

  src="/img/posts/why-you-should-use-floats-in-your-projects/complexity-chart.png"
  width="1200"
  height="880"
  alt="Complexity of individual approaches"
/>

As you can see, the difference is enormous. So why wonder what will be appropriate and how to write it down? Just use floats!

## Better than tables

After all these considerations, you might want to consider using tables to create a layout. Don't do this! Tables should be used to create tables and for nothing else!

Using a table layout is really a prehistoric approach that should never take place. Fortunately, our beloved floats have been introduced, with which we can easily create a beautiful layout. üíñ

If they weren't, would we still be using tables? Think about it and admit that you have to recognize the superiority of the floats again.

## Conclusion

I hope I was able to convince you with this post why you should continue to use floats in 2022. You may accuse me of being biased, but you should ask yourself if you have not experienced the situations described above.

So don't listen to any pseudo-programmer, but think for yourself and use the best tools! üòú

See you next time! üëã (maybe in more serious post)
