<div id="introduction">
  I always wanted to create a UI library, but my design skills, in short, didn't allow for it ðŸ˜Š So
  I decided to create something as simple as possible. Smooth, short animations, whose code you can
  directly download and place on your site, this was my task.
</div>

## Tech stack

I know I'm repeating myself, but yes, and this time I used **TypeScript**.

What am I used for animations? Short question, quick answer - **GSAP** is responsible for all functionality related to animations. Looping, delaying, resetting, I could go on and on.

All files with graphics are in `.svg` format so I can easily manipulate individual elements.

The whole app was builded and packed with **Parcel**, to reduce files' size and increase performance ðŸ’ª

## Problems

The biggest problem was to work out all the details related to the design of graphics and animation itself. A millisecond this way or that way? How about a pixel to the left? A little different easing? These are not as easy questions as you may think! Good animation must have everything down to the smallest detail.

On the code side, I can't mention too much, because there was no complicated logic here, and the styles themselves as well as the structure are very simple.

## Lessons learned

I knew a lot about designing. Easings, colors, schemas, uff, how do you, designers deal with this?

I'd like to remind you that I learned about one of the most popular libraries for animation. I think this experience will pay off in the future.

Using **Parcel** allowed me to get acquainted with another tool useful for building websites.

All in all, I think the app came out pretty good and I got a lot out of it in terms of knowledge ðŸ’ª
