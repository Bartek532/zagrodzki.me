<div id="introduction">
  Yeah, yeah, I know the name isn't the best. But the most important thing is the code! 😉 This is
  simple shop project, where you can select products, add them to basket and pay for them at the
  checkout. Simple, but quite good and with prospects for future growth.

## Tech stack

New project, new technologies ⚙️

This is where I first used external CMS to manage content. I decided to try with **DatoCMS** and I think something good came out of it.

I also used **Firebase**, and, okay, you can tell I've taken the shortest route, but I want to learn how to use **BaaS** (_Backend as a Service_) in real project.

Payments are made with **Stripe**, so you can pay comfortably and securely 💵

Of course, the whole app was written in **TypeScript** and **Next.js** 😁

## Problems

Hmm, I don’t remember any major problems that I had making this project. I took it step by step, I read up when I didn't know something and everything seems very clear to me.

But, if I had to mention any difficulties, I think I would point out the tests 🧪 It was my first time with testing app this size and I have to take care a lot of thing to make other things work.

## Lessons learned

I learnt the most about **tests**. Which components should I test, how should I do this and many, many more. They’re very important to our apps, because they’re giving us confidence that the final user can use the app safely.

I solidify my **React knowledge** too, using many libraries, such as Stripe to handle payments or Styled Components - to learn a new way to style the components.
