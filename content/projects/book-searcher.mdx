<div id="introduction">

Every time I wanted to find a book in my house I have to spend a lot of time to do this. So I decide to **digitalize** it! Database, forms, some code and it’s live.

Now the administration panel is, what may surprise you, available for everyone, so you too can add your own book, but in a few moments I will block this access so only my closest ones can access it. I want to show all functionalities to as many people as I can before I do this.

## Tech stack

As you can see below I built two versions of Book Searcher. First, I tried to use **MongoDB**, **Vuex** and more... not quite the right technologies 😁 This project is still on my <Link href="https://github.com/Bartek532/book-searcher-mongo">Github</Link>, so you can see the code. When my app was growing up it turned out that I need relations, more control of my state, better validation, so I figured I'd use a different stack.

Basically, the whole app have been written in **TypeScript** (too obvious?). At the back I used **Express.js** and **PostgreSQL**
with **Prisma** for database. On the front end I bet on **Vue** and I think it paid off 💰

## Problems

I spent most of my time preparing the view and the logic involved in adding the book. A lot of **validation**, **error messages**, **relations** had to be done at this stage. But I can’t leave out that I learnt a lot doing this.

If I had to name one more thing it would be **authorization**. Handling user permissions, sending suitable status codes, it sounds so simple, but trust me, in more advanced cases it can be very irritating 🤐

## Lessons learned

It's impossible to count Vue libraries that I got to know while working with this project. Not all working as I expected, but I didn’t give up 😉

It’s worth noting that this was my first application of this size built with **Vue 3**. I have often looked at the documentation, but it has allowed me to delve more deeply into the subject.
