<div id="introduction">
  I personally used this application for some period of time, because when I want to quick note
  something it suits me well. A lot of features, integrations, and more. Later, I discover{" "}
  <Link href="https://notion.so">Notion</Link> and the life of my notes changed 180 degrees, but I
  think this is material for a separate article 😉
</div>

## Tech stack

Yeah, another app that was written in **TypeScript** 😁 On the backend it uses **Express.js**, authentication was made with OAuth.

**React** and **Redux** form the core of the frontend and everything is covered by a significant amount of testing.

For text editing and all the functionality associated with it, **Codemirror** was used and I think it does the job.

## Open source journey

This application is special to me because it was the first open source project I was involved in. As I mention before I used it and in my opinion keyboard navigation wasn’t as good as it could have been. So I opened my first <Link href="https://github.com/taniarascia/takenote/pull/509">pull request</Link> in the project this size. And causing my indescribable happiness it was accepted!

Call me an **Open Source Developer**! 😅

Honestly, I have had more ideas for improvements, but, unfortunately, the main contributor - <Link href="https://github.com/taniarascia">Tania Rascia</Link>, although she accepted most of them, she didn’t answer my questions, and the project stalled.

I hope that someday there will be more activity associated with it and I can help to further improve it 💪

## Lessons learned

I learnt a lot about how to setup project to be accessible to people who want to contribute to it.

I appreciated the tools such as **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and **Husky** which make collaborating with others much easier. They set the rules so that everything is more transparent and the developer's personal settings don’t affect the whole project.

It’s worth mentioning that I also learned how to use and transform **Markdown**, which allows me to at least create this description.

So, I have to say: “Thank you, TakeNote!” 😅
