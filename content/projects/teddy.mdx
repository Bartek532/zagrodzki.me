<div id="introduction">

Teddy was initially developed during <Link href="https://verified.sertifier.com/en/verify/55140061168727/"> one of my AI trainings.</Link> The idea was to create a proof of concept of an **AI assistant** that could help with daily tasks.

The project began by experimenting with **prompts** in the command line and playground. After a while, I decided to create a more user-friendly interface. After developing **desktop app** and implementing advanced prompts Teddy was born üß∏

Now, I use it daily, utilizing useful snippets and remote actions to automate my workflow.

## Tech stack

When developing the app, I separated two main domains - **app** itself and the **AI** part.

### App

Well, I had **never** built a desktop app before.

Moreover, I had **never** used **Rust**, but I had heard many good things about it. So, I decided to give it a try and use **Tauri** to create a desktop app üöÄ

In the end, it was a great decision. **Tauri** is a fantastic tool that allows you to create a desktop app using web technologies. It's easy to use and has many features that I extensively used, such as **notifications**, **shortcuts**, **local storage**, and many, many more.

Of course, as with all of my projects, I used **TypeScript** to make the development process more enjoyable and less error-prone.

For styling, I leveraged my new favorite tool - **TailwindCSS**. It's a great tool that allows you to create beautiful designs without writing much CSS. Maybe I should write a blog post about my favorite techniques in it? ü§î

Last but probably most important - I implemented custom **GitHub Actions** that allow me to _build_ and _release_ new versions of the app with just one click. There were some troubles setting it up correctly, but in the end, it saved me at least **30+** hours of manual work! üî•

### AI

I've tested many AI models and providers, such as **Gemini**, **Claude**, **Ollama**, and even more that no longer exist.

However, I decided to use **OpenAI**'s **GPT**. It's a great tool that allows you to generate text based on the prompt you provide. It's really powerful and can be used in many different ways üí™

They provide a great API that I used to communicate with the LLM model.

I experimented a lot with different **prompts** and **techniques** (chain-of-thought, I'm looking at you! üòÅ) and finally achieved satisfying results.

Of course, it could be better, and as you're reading this, there are probably even simpler ways to achieve the same, but I'm happy with how it works now and the knowledge I gained during the process.

## Problems

To my surprise, I didn't have many problems with the **app** part.

As I'm pretty experienced with React and TypeScript, I managed to create the app in just a **few days** üöÄ

Trying some Rust things was a bit challenging, but I managed to get through it with the help of the Tauri documentation and **Teddy itself (!).**

The **AI** part was a lot harder üò¨

I tested tons of different flows, prompts, and techniques to correctly determine the intention of the message and then handle generating the most accurate response.

I also implemented a lot of useful snippets that I can use everywhere on my OS just by invoking the **correct** shortcut. Here are some examples of the most useful ones:

- Fixing code
- Translating text
- Creating a new note
- Explaining concepts step-by-step

The hardest part were probably **remote actions**. I wanted to invoke some third-party APIs directly in the chat (e.g., playing music from Spotify). This includes specifying an intention, generating a payload, calling the external API, parsing the response, etc. A lot of potential **bottlenecks**!

But, at the end of the day, I managed to create a **working prototype** that I use daily. It's not perfect, but it's a **great tool** that helps me with my daily tasks üî•

## Lessons learned

One of the most significant lessons I learned was the value of **not be scared of new technologies**. Despite having no prior experience with Rust, I decided to give it a try. Using Tauri to create a desktop app was a challenging yet rewarding experience.

The AI part of the project required **extensive testing and iteration**. Experimenting with prompt engineering to fine-tune the AI's responses taught me the importance of patience and persistence.

Constant testing and incremental improvements are key to developing a robust AI system. I explored numerous AI models and providers, ultimately deciding on OpenAI's GPT.

Worth mentioning, that determining the user's intent and generating the most accurate response was a significant challenge. I learned the importance of context and nuanced understanding in AI interactions.

Throughout this project, **continuous learning** and application of new knowledge were vital. I learned a lot about **desktop app development**, **AI**, and **automation**. This knowledge helped me a lot in developing further products.

And it all started with a single **snippet**... üß∏
