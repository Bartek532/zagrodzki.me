<div id="introduction">
  At the beginning I have to mention that, this is a copy of original{" "}
  <Link href="https://github.com/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator">GPRG</Link>. But, why
  I rewrote fully functioning app? I used it a couple of times and I looked in the code. Imagine my
  surprise when I discovered that the project doesn't use TypeScript 😯 I had to change it!
</div>

## Tech stack

Yeah, I rewrote the app to **TypeScript**. And this is the biggest change.

It was the first time I worked with **Gatsby**, but it wasn't a big problem for me. I discover the power of plugins, but, honestly I still prefer **Next.js** 😉

Integration with Markdown was also interesting for me I got to see it in action.

Worth mentioning, that app is using **TailwindCSS**, but I didn't have to work too much with it, because my task was to focus on **JavaScript** code.

## Problems

Problems? Hmm, no more than in any project you need to know in order to participate.

Of course, I had moments, when I asked yourself: “Why is it so?”, but I always found the answer in the end.

Sometimes it took some time, but it enabled me to learn other developers' points of view and confront our solutions.

I didn't have to touch stylings, so the biggest was disappeared 😅

## Lessons learned

First of all, I learned how to use **Gatsby**, its plugins and other tools.

I used **GraphQL** for quering and retrieving data and I think it's quite simple and readable.

And the most important thing - I have written a lot of **TypeScript** code (Github indicates about 89%), using Utility Types, Type Manipulation and few other features that make the code more safe and simpler.

The app is fully working, so you can generate your next README using it (with **TypeScript** 😁).
