<div id="introduction">
  I decided to build something like this, because I always dreamed about website with many
  functionalities, where the user can have his own account and can influence the main content. My
  choice was to create portal with job offers, I wanted to help people (myself?) get a dream work.
  Imagine that I could search for my first job in my own app!
</div>

## Tech stack

Always, when I'm going to build something new I want to choose technologies, that I had never worked with. Here, I built my first backend! I used **Express.js**, **PostgreSQL** and many more libraries to handle everything on the page.

Authenticating users, validating offers, checking permissions, uff, it all took a lot of time and work to cover all edge cases.

On the front end, my choice was **Next.js**, I also used (and learned) **Redux** to manage state. Of course, I wrote the whole app in **TypeScript** without which I can‚Äôt imagine the project now.

## Problems

The biggest problem, in my opinion, was **the vastness of the dependencies that had to be addressed**. It was my first time working with a code of this size and I will say that at first it wasn‚Äôt easy. But, when I walked through the app hundreds of times I began to feel more and more comfortable.

Another problem, that I can mention is **validation**. Previously, I don‚Äôt know how many checks should be done, when user attempt to e.g. sign up or edit offer. It wasn't until I had to implement it myself that I realized how tedious the process is.

But finally, I think everything is working fine ü•∞

## Lessons learned

Where to start? If I were to describe everything I've learned, there would be something like an infinite scroll. This project helped to solidify a lot my **TypeScript and React knowledge**.

I learn how to use a lot of tools, that are used in today‚Äôs development. In addition, I read a couple of articles about design, typography and colors to make my app the best possible in UI and UX üí™
